## about me

<table>
<tr>
<td width="70%">

**computer science student @ inteli** • **software engineer @ qi tech**

been taking things apart since i was 9 — hardware, software, systems. the curiosity never stopped.

currently working with **banking-as-a-service** systems, automating critical processes, and exploring the intersection of **software engineering** and **cybersecurity**.

don't have all the answers, but i'm here to learn, experiment, and build. life's a puzzle, and i'm still figuring it out.
